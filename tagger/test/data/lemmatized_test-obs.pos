ha
spent

He
last
made
wave

he
dared
to
defend
an
Indian
girl
who
had
been
adopted
by
non-Indian
parent
off
her
reservation
.
<s>
Mr.
Allen
quickly
ran
up
against
the
liberal
establishment
again
,
which
somehow
elevated
the
vague
concept
of
``
Indian
right
''
above
the
right
of
individual
Indians
.
<s>
There
is
a
huge
divide
between

view

the
divisive
litigation
approach
of

group

the
gap

large

That

the
conventional
theory
anyway

In
practice
,
however
,
the
line
between
interpretation
and
redefinition
of
the
criminal
law
long
ago
began
to
blur
.
<s>
In
particular
,
a
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
ha
developed
with
surprising
rapidity
over
the
past
decade
.
<s>
For
example
,
although
insider
trading
ha
long
been
criminal
,
it
ha
never
been
statutorily
defined
.
<s>
In
1983
,
the
Supreme
Court
tried
to
supply
a
workable
definition
in
the
Dirks
v.
SEC
decision
,
which
found
that
liability
depended
on
whether
the
tipper
had
breached
his
fiduciary
duty
to
the
corporation
in
order
to
obtain
``
some
personal
gain
''
and
whether
the
tippee
knew
or
recklessly
disregarded
this
fact
.
<s>
Gradually
,
however
,
lower
court
and
prosecutor
have
pushed
this
definition
to
it
breaking
point
.
<s>
Consider
the
fact
underlying
the
1989
conviction
of
Robert
Chestman
.
<s>
Prior
to
a
tender
offer
by
A&P
for
Waldbaum
Inc.
in
1986
,
the
founder
of
the
Waldbaum
's
supermarket
chain
called
an
elderly
relative
to
tell
her
to
assemble
her
stock
certificate
for
delivery
.
<s>
She
called
her
daughter
to
take
her
to
the
bank
,
who
,
in
turn
,
persuaded
her
husband
,
a
Mr.
Loeb
,
to
run
this
errand
.
<s>
Hearing
of
this
information
,
the
husband
discussed
it
with
his
broker
,
Mr.
Chestman
,
and
Mr.
Chestman
then
bought
for
his
own
account
and
other
client
.
<s>
Basically
,
Mr.
Chestman
wa
a
fourth-level
tippee
.
<s>
Did
Mr.
Loeb
,
his
tipper
,
breach
a
fiduciary
duty
-LRB-
and
,
if
so
,
to
whom
-RRB-
?
<s>
Did
Mr.
Loeb
seek
personal
gain
-LRB-
and
if
so
,
how
-RRB-
?
<s>
Or
did
Mr.
Chestman
only
hear
a
market
rumor
-LRB-
which
one
may
lawfully
trade
upon
-RRB-
?
<s>
The
line
seems
awfully
thin
for
criminal-law
purpose
.
<s>
A
second
illustration
is
supplied
by
the
recent
guilty
plea
entered
by
Robert
Freeman
,
formerly
head
of
arbitrage
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.
<s>
Essentially
,
Mr.
Freeman
had
invested
heavily
in
the
Beatrice
leveraged
buy-out
,
when
he
wa
told
by
another
prominent
trader
,
Bernard
``
Bunny
''
Lasker
,
that
the
deal
wa
in
trouble
.
<s>
After
placing
order
to
sell
,
Mr.
Freeman
called
Martin
Siegel
,
an
investment
banker
at
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
,
who
wa
advising
on
the
deal
,
to
confirm
these
rumor
.
<s>
Mr.
Siegel
asked
Mr.
Freeman
who
his
source
wa
and
,
on
hearing
that
it
wa
Bunny
Lasker
,
responded
:
``
Well
,
your
bunny
ha
a
good
nose
.
''
<s>
The
illegal
``
tip
''
of
the
bunny
's
good
nose
wa
then
largely
a
confirmation
of
rumor
already
known
to
many
in
the
market
.
<s>
Had
the
case
gone
to
trial
the
same
issue
would
have
surfaced
:
<s>
Was
there
a
fiduciary
breach
in
order
to
obtain
personal
gain
?
<s>
Did
Mr.
Freeman
have
notice
of
this
?
<s>
Finally
,
wa
the
information
material
?
<s>
Yet
,
all
these
issue
are
subsidiary
to
a
more
central
issue
:
Who
is
and
who
should
be
making
the
criminal
law
here
?
<s>
It
is
not
my
contention
that
either
Mr.
Chestman
or
Mr.
Freeman
wa
an
innocent
victim
of
prosecutorial
overzealousness
.
<s>
Arguably
,
both
were
on
notice
that
their
behavior
wa
at
least
risky
.
<s>
But
even
if
they
behaved
recklessly
,
reason
still
exist
to
fear
and
resist
this
steady
process
of
case-by-case
judicial
extension
of
the
law
of
insider
trading
.
<s>
Courts
and
legislature
make
decision
in
very
different
way
and
are
each
susceptible
to
very
different
kind
of
error
.
<s>
After-the-fact
judicial
examination
of
an
actor
's
conduct
ha
always
been
the
common
law
's
method
.
<s>
When
only
civil
liability
is
involved
,
this
method
ha
the
undeniable
strength
of
factual
specificity
and
avoidance
of
overgeneralization
.
<s>
Still
,
case-by-case
retrospective
decision
making
of
this
sort
is
vulnerable
to
the
tunnel
vision
caused
by
a
fixation
on
ad
hoc
-LRB-
and
usually
sleazy
-RRB-
example
.
<s>
When
a
court
decides
that
a
particular
actor
's
conduct
wa
culpable
and
so
extends
the
definition
of
insider
trading
to
reach
this
conduct
,
it
doe
not
see
the
potentially
enormous
number
of
other
case
that
will
be
covered
by
the
expanded
rule
.
<s>
Thus
,
a
court
is
poorly
positioned
to
make
judgment
about
the
social
utility
of
the
expanded
rule
.
<s>
For
example
,
in
focusing
on
Mr.
Freeman
's
attempt
to
gain
nonpublic
information
about
a
deal
's
collapse
,
one
doe
not
naturally
think
about
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
:
What
if
the
rumor
had
been
false
?
<s>
Can
a
security
analyst
call
an
investment
banker
to
make
certain
that
a
seemingly
improbable
rumor
is
in
fact
false
?
<s>
In
the
past
,
not
only
would
reputable
professional
have
rushed
to
check
out
such
rumor
with
the
company
,
but
company
listed
on
the
major
stock
exchange
were
encouraged
by
the
exchange
to
respond
openly
to
such
inquiry
from
security
analyst
.
<s>
Today
,
after
Mr.
Freeman
's
plea
,
there
is
an
uncertainty
that
is
both
unfair
and
inefficient
.
<s>
In
this
light
,
the
comparative
advantage
of
legislative
law-making
become
clear
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
Before
it
act
,
the
legislature
typically
will
hear
the
view
of
representative
of
all
those
affected
by
it
decision
,
not
just
the
immediate
party
before
the
court
;
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
the
legislature
can
frame
``
bright
line
''
standard
that
create
le
uncertainty
than
the
fact-bound
decision
of
court
.
<s>
Although
legislative
line
can
result
in
under-inclusion
-LRB-
which
explains
why
the
SEC
ha
long
resisted
a
legislative
definition
of
insider
trading
-RRB-
,
judicial
lawmaking
inevitably
creates
uncertainty
because
of
the
shadowy
outer
edge
and
implication
of
most
judicial
decision
.
<s>
At
least
when
the
stake
are
high
,
uncertainty
in
turn
result
in
overinclusion
,
a
individual
do
not
dare
to
approach
an
uncertain
line
closely
.
<s>
The
federal
mail
and
wire
fraud
statute
provide
even
better
illustration
of
the
rapid
evolution
of
a
federal
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
.
<s>
In
1987
,
the
Supreme
Court
attempted
in
McNally
v.
U.S.
to
halt
the
inexorable
expansion
of
these
statute
by
adopting
a
rule
of
strict
construction
for
ambiguous
criminal
statue
.
<s>
Yet
,
late
last
year
,
Congress
effectively
reversed
this
decision
by
enacting
a
one-sentence
statute
that
defined
fraud
to
include
any
scheme
to
deprive
another
of
``
the
intangible
right
of
honest
service
.
''
<s>
At
a
stroke
,
this
may
criminalize
all
fiduciary
breach
-LRB-
and
possibly
all
misrepresentation
by
an
agent
or
employee
-RRB-
.
<s>
Such
a
statute
illustrates
the
fundamental
problem
:
Congress
find
it
is
easier
to
pas
sweepingly
moralistic
prohibition
,
which
the
court
must
thereafter
interpret
,
than
to
engage
in
the
difficult
line-drawing
distinction
that
are
inherently
it
responsibility
.
<s>
We
are

judicial
power
grab

<s>
Predictably

dubious
behavior

prosecutor
will
exploit
the
latitude

At

three
other
factor
have
encouraged

,
it
argues

the

ha
left

than

<s>
Third
,
the

like

While

politics

there
is
a
clear
economic
case
against

<s>
Opponents
of

argue
that

practice
central
planning

They
question
whether

country

Opponents
show
that

are
already
more
fund
available

<s>
They
worry
that

up

debt

They
believe

the
key
to

<s>
Decisions
on
increase

politics

Liberals
may
support

stabilizing

quasi-governmental
role

two
condition

would
fret

Because
commercial
bank

believe

will
get
a
piece
of

Furthermore
,
a
U.S.
rejection

would
give

On

But
this
year
,
when
the
hullabaloo
surrounding
it
centennial
died
,
so
too
did
some
advertiser
interest
.
<s>
The
reason
,
ad
executive
say
,
is
that
the
entire
magazine
business
ha
been
soft
--
and
National
Geographic
ha
some
quirk
that
make
it
especially
unattractive
during
a
soft
market
.
<s>
Perhaps
the
biggest
of
those
factor
is
it
high
ad
price
--
$
130,000
for
a
four-color
page
,
vs.
$
47,000
for
the
Smithsonian
,
a
comparable
publication
with
a
far
smaller
circulation
.

When

tight

the
high

cost
is
a
major
deterrent
for
advertiser
,
who
generally
want
to
appear
regularly
in
a

or
not
at

Even
though
National

offer
far
more

a

to
develop
any
frequency

''
say
Harry
Glass
,
New

medium
manager
for
Bozell
Inc
.
<s>
To
combat
that
problem
,
National
Geographic
,
like
other
magazine
,
began
offering
regional
edition
allowing
advertiser
to
appear
in
only
a
portion
of
it

for
example
,
ad
can
run
only
in
the

But
the
magazine
wa
slower
than
it
competitor
to
come
up
with
it
regional
edition
,

until
last
year
offered
fewer
of
them
than
did

more

100

going

other
group

<s>
Another
sticking
point
for
advertiser
wa
National
Geographic
's
tradition
of
lumping
it
ad
together
,
usually
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
the

,
rather
than
spreading
ad
out
among
it
article

a
most

do

National

smaller-than-average

mean
extra

The

on

a
move
almost
certain
to
infuriate

The

said
it
will

Dual

give
an
exchange
trader
the
right
to
trade
both
for
his

for

The
issue
exploded
this

to

While
not
specifically
mentioned
in

dual

became
a
focus
of
attempt
to
tighten
industry
regulation

<s>
Critics
contend
that
trader
were
putting
buying
or
selling
for
their
own
account
ahead
of
other
trader
'
customer
order
.
<s>
Traders
are
likely
to
oppose
such
restriction
because
dual
trading
provides
a
way
to
make
money
in
slower
market
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
customer
order
.
<s>
The
exchange
contend
that
dual
trading
improves
liquidity
in
the
market
because
trader
can
buy
or
sell
even
when
they
do
n't
have
a
customer
order
in

The
exchange
say
liquidity
becomes

severe
problem

The
CFTC
may
take
those
argument
into

allowing
exception

it
restriction

The
agency
did
n't
cite
specific
situation

have
proposed
restricting

would
prohibit

In

Raeder

the
German

threatened
to
attack
the

,
so
we
created
the
Southern
Command
in

The
Southern
Command
ha
grown
even
bigger
since

Raeder

sometimes
run

dressed

The
ghost
of
the
Soviet
brigade
discovered
in
Cuba
back
in
the
'70s
cost
just
a
few
hundred
million

the
price
of
the
Caribbean
Command
in
Key
West
that
President

created
in

The

George
Marshall
's
ghost
is
much
more
difficult

We
keep
a
lot
of
shrine

him
around

statue
,
bust

relic

such
.
<s>
The
Army
headquarters
on

third
deck
of

Pentagon
used
to
burn
a
lot
of
incense
to
him
,
but
the
Navy
headquarters
on
the
fourth
deck
made
them
stop
it
.
<s>
You
see
,
Marshall
had
this
thing
about
the
Navy

the
Marines
--
he
wanted
to
make
them
part
of
the
Army
but
Secretary
of
the
Navy
James
Forrestal
blocked
him
.
<s>
Now
his
ghost
wo
n't
let
up
till
it
's
done
.
<s>
To
keep
him
quiet
we
invent
a
new
unified
command
every
year
or
so
run
by
the
Army
or
the
Air
Force
and
put
more
of
the
Navy

Marines
under
it
.
<s>
But
we
still
hear
him
moaning
at
night
because
the
Navy
ha
a
few
ship
left
,
and
to
satisfy
him
the
Navy
's
sea
lift
force
were
given
to
a
new
Air

in
Illinois

it

force

an
Army

.
<s>
Which
brings
up
the
worst
and
meanest
ghost
of
all
--
the
ghost
of
the
shah
of
Iran
.
<s>
When
the
shah
died
,
President
Carter
wa
so
scared
that
the
shah
's
ghost
would
blame
him
for
shoving
him
out
to
make
way
for
the
ayatollah
that
he
declared
the
Carter
Doctrine
.
<s>
Mr.
Carter
said
he
would
go
to
war
to
stop
anyone
from
trying
to
grab
Iran
.
<s>
But
that
ghost
would
n't
settle
for
word
,
he
wanted
money
and
people
--
lot
.
<s>
So
Mr.
Carter
formed
three
new
Army
division
and
gave
them
to
a
new
bureaucracy
in
Tampa
called
the
Rapid
Deployment
Force
.
<s>
But
that
ghost
wa
n't
fooled
;
he
knew
the
RDF
wa
neither
rapid
nor
deployable
nor
a
force
--
even
though
it
cost
$
8
billion
or
$
10
billion
a
year
.
<s>
After
Mr.
Carter
wa
defeated
in
1980
,
the
shah
's
ghost
claimed
the
credit
and
then
went
after
President
Reagan
and
Cap
Weinberger
.
<s>
I
saw
what
he
did
to
them
firsthand
.

It
made
my
shoelace
dance
with
terror
.
<s>
Why
,
he
used
to
lay
in
wait
for
Cap
;
suddenly
he
'd
leap
from
behind
some
statue
of
Marshall
onto
Cap
's
chest
and
grab
him
by
the
throat
and
choke
him
till
he
coughed
up
an
additional
$
2
billion
or
so
.
<s>
Cap
added
four
more
division
to
the
Army
,
two
active
and
two
reserve
;
two
carrier
group
to
the
Navy
;
a
division
--
equivalent
to
the
Marines
;
and
the
C-5B
,
KC-10
,
C-17
and
a
thousand
tactical
aircraft
to
the
Air
Force
.
<s>
He
bought
$
4
billion
in
prepositioning
ship
and
$
7
billion
in
ammo
and
equipment
to
fill
them
,
and
parked
them
at
a
new
$
6
billion
base
at
Diego
Garcia
in
the
middle
of
the
Indian
Ocean
.
<s>
He
dedicated
all
these
new
force
to
the
Persian
Gulf
.
<s>
One
night
both
Marshall
's
ghost
and
the
shah
's
ghost
together
caught
Cap
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
.
<s>
Before
they
let
him
go
he
added
a
thousand
bureaucrat
to
the
RDF
in
Tampa
and
renamed
it
Central
Command
.
<s>
He
gave
those
bureaucrat
charge
of
all
naval
operation
in
the
Persian
Gulf
and
Indian
Ocean
.
<s>
Marshall
figured
it
would
be
good
training
for
those
soldier
--
someday
maybe
they
would
get
the
whole
Navy
.
<s>
They
had
fun
moving
the
carrier
around
,
but
it
turned
out
that
they
had
forgotten
all
about
mine
sweeper
.
<s>
But
the
shah
still
kept
leaping
out
at
Cap
,
so
Cap
bought
a
hundred
merchant
ship
more
and
$
7
billion
of
loading
barge
,
ramp
,
etc.
,
in
order
that
those
seven
new
Army
division
and
three
Marine
brigade
could
unload
from
all
those
new
ship
and
aircraft
and
go
to
war
in
the
Zagros
mountain
.
<s>
Then
suddenly
Ike

came
to
visit
and
said
,
``

Lucky
for
Cap
,
Ike
wa
easygoing
and
soon
went
away
,
while
the

--
he
kept
coming
back

So
the

itself
paying

canceled

cut
back

canceled

Finally

Justice
Stevens

Because
despite

Do

genre

It
is
true
that

one

imagine

<s>
Back
in

1920s

the

made
the
theme
of
courtship
between
the
assimilated
offspring
of
Jewish
and
Irish

so
popular
that
it
author
,
Anne
Nichols

lost
a

suit
on

ground
that
the
plot
ha
entered
the
public
domain

And
it
ha
remained
there
,
a
evidenced
by
it
reappearance
in
a
1972
CBS
sitcom
called
``
Bridget
Loves
Bernie
,
''
whose
sole
distinction
wa
that
it
led
to
the
real-life
marriage
of
Meredith
Baxter
and
David
Birney
.
<s>
Clearly
,
the
question
with
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
not
whether
the
pot
will
boil
over
,
but
whether
it
will
simmer
at
all
.
<s>
So
far
,
the
bubble
have
been
few
and
far
between
.
<s>
Part
of
the
problem
is
the
tendency
of
all
sitcom
,
ever
since
the
didactic
day
of
Norman
Lear
,
to
preach
about
social
issue
.
<s>
To
some
extent
,
this
tendency
emerges
whenever
the
show
try
to
enlighten
u
about
ethnic
stereotype
by
reversing
them
.
<s>
For
instance
,
Michael
dislike
Jackie
not
because
he
's
a
shrewd
Jewish
businessman
,
but
because
he
quits
his
well-paying
job
a
a
salesman
in
order
to
become
a
social
worker
.
<s>
Even
more
problematic
is
the
incompatibility
between
sitcom
preachiness
and
Mr.
Mason
's
comic
persona
.
<s>
The
best
moment
in
the
show
occur
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
-LRB-
and
occasionally
in
the
middle
-RRB-
,
when
Mr.
Mason
slip
into
his
standup
mode
and
start
meting
out
that
old-fashioned
Jewish
mischief
to
other
people
a
well
a
to
himself
.
<s>
But
too
often
,
these
routine
lack
spark
because
this
sitcom
,
like
all
sitcom
,
is
timid
about
confronting
Mr.
Mason
's
stock
in
trade
-
ethnic
difference
.
<s>
I
'm
not
suggesting
that
the
producer
start
putting
together
episode
about
topic
like
the
Catholic-Jewish
dispute
over
the
Carmelite
convent
at
Auschwitz

That
issue
,
like
racial
tension

will
have
to
cool
down

not
heat
up

before
it
can
simmer

<s>
But
I
am
suggesting
that
they
stop
requiring
Mr.
Mason
to
interrupt
his
classic
shtik
with
some
line
about
``

I
disagree
with
the
statement

not
draw
an
adverse
inference
against
former
HUD
official
who
assert
their
Fifth
Amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in

hearing
.
<s>
The
Fifth
Amendment
state
in
relevant
part
that
no
person
``
shall
be
compelled
,
in
any
criminal
case
,
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
.
''
<s>
This
privilege
against
self-incrimination
precludes
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
a
criminal
defendant
who
chooses
not
to
testify
.
<s>
Thus
,
in
a
criminal
case
,
a
prosecutor
can
not
comment
on
a
defendant
's
failure
to
testify
nor
can
the
defendant
be
compelled
to
take
the
stand
a
a
witness
,
thus
forcing
him
to
``
take
the
Fifth

''

The
privilege
,
however
,
ha
been
limited
in
accordance
with
it
plain
language
to
protect
the
defendant
in
criminal
matter
only
.
<s>
The
Supreme
Court
and
some
state
have
specifically
recognized
that
``
the
Fifth

not

the
inference
where

<s>
Thus
,
in
a
civil
case
,
a
defendant
may
be
called
a
a
witness
,
he
may
be
forced
to
testify
or
take
the
Fifth
,
and
his
taking
of

permit
the
drawing
of

adverse

He
may
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
only
if
he
ha
a
good
faith
and
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
may
subject
him
to
criminal
prosecution
.
<s>
Allowing
the
defendant
to
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
is
not
based
on
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
testify
where
one
's
testimony
harm
him
in
the
civil
matter
,
but
because
the
testimony
in
the
civil
matter
could
be
unconstitutionally
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.
<s>
Absent
the
risk
of
such
prosecution
,
a
court
may
order
the
defendant
to
testify
.
<s>
Thus
,
when
Mr.
Pierce
asserted
the
Fifth
in
a
noncriminal
proceeding
,
particularly
after
presumably
receiving
extensive
advice
from
legal
counsel
,
one
must
conclude
that
he
held
a
good-faith
,
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.
<s>
The
subcommittee
,
Congress
and
the
American
public
have
every
right
to
draw
the
adverse
inference
and
to
concur
with
Mr.
Pierce
's
own
belief
that
his
testimony
could
help
convict
him
of
a
crime
.
<s>
Drawing

The

how
his
decision
might
affect
a

Some

say
uncertainty
about
Washington

anti-takeover
policy
wa
one
reason
that
financing
for
the
United
Airlines
takeover
fell
through
--
the
event
that
triggered
the
market
drop
.
<s>
In
many
way
,
the
backdrop
to
Friday
's
stock
decline
is
eerily
similar
to
that
of
October
1987
's
508-point
crash
.
<s>
Then
,
a
now
,
the
budget
debate
wa
behind

automatic
spending
cut
were
within
day
of
taking
hold
.
<s>
The
Treasury
wa
locked
in
a
battle
over

economic
policy
,

at

it

with

concern

--
then
by
the
tax-writing
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee

the
Transportation
Department
--
were
making
market
nervous
.
<s>
The
1987
crash
brought
the
Reagan
administration
and
Democratic
lawmaker
to
the
table
for
the
first
budget
summit
,
resulting
in
a
two-year
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
76

though
the
deficit
actually
rose

12

Lawmakers

n't
enough
to
force
both
side
back

try
to
reach
a

would
be
more
serious
and
more
far-reaching
than

fully

One
of
the
biggest
reason
that

n't
likely

that
,
a
everyone
learned

``

''
ha
no

meaning
.

Would

be
voluntary
or
compulsory
?

Short

?

Part-time
or

?

Paid

live

work

?
<s>
What
kind
of
work
would
they
do
?
<s>
What
doe
``
national
''
mean
?

Would
the
program
be
run
by

federal
government

by

private
voluntary
organization
?

And
who
would
serve
?

Only
male

with

Youth
only

Middle-class

Many
or

?
<s>
Those
are
not
trivial
question
,
and
the
label
``
national
service
''
answer
none
of
them
.
<s>
Then
how
should
we
think
about
national
service
?
<s>
As
a
starting
point
,
here
are
five
proposition
:
1
.
Consider
the
ingredient
,
not
the
name
.
<s>
Ignore
``
national
service
''
in
the
abstract
;
consider
specific
proposal
.
<s>
They
will
differ
in
crucial
way
.
<s>
2
.
``
Service
''
should
be
service
.
<s>
As
commonly
understood
,
service
implies
sacrifice
.
<s>
It
involves
accepting
risk
,
or
giving
up
income
,
or
deferring
a
career
.
<s>
It
follows
that
proposal
like
Nunn-McCurdy
,
whose
benefit
to
enrollee
are
worth
some
$
17,500
a
year
,
do
not
qualify
.
<s>
There
is
a
rationale
for
such
bill
:
Federal
subsidy
to
college
student
amount
to
``
a
GI
Bill
without
the
GI
''
;
arguably
those
benefit
should
be
earned
,
not
given
.
<s>
But
the
earnings
exceed
by
20
%
the
average
income
of
young
high-school
graduate
with
full-time
job
.
<s>
Why
call
that
service
?
<s>
3
.
Encouragement
is
fine
;
compulsion
is
not
.
<s>
Compelled
service
is
unconstitutional
.
<s>
It
is
also
unwise
and
unenforceable
.
<s>
-LRB-
Who
will
throw
several
hundred
thousand
refusers
in
jail
each
year
?
-RRB-
<s>
But
through
tax
policy
and
in
other
way
the
federal
government
encourages
many
kind
of
behavior
.
<s>
It
should
also
encourage
service
--
preferably
by
all
class
and
all
age
.
<s>
Its
encouragement
should
strengthen
and
not
undercut
the
strong
tradition
of
volunteering
in
the
U.S.
,
should
build
on
the
service
program
already
in
existence

and
should
honor
local
conviction
about
which
task
most
need
doing
.

Good
program
are
not
cheap

<s>
Enthusiasts
assume
that
national
service
would
get
important
work
done
cheaply

forest
fire
fought

housing
rehabilitated
,
student
tutored

day-care
center
staffed

There
is
important
work
to
be
done

and

shown

start
with
few
skill

do
much
of
it
well

not
cheaply

Good
service
program
require
recruitment
,
screening

training

supervision

<s>
Full-time
residential

also
require
housing

full-time

they
are
particularly
expensive

more

<s>
Non-residential
program
are
cheaper

good
one
still
come
to
some
$
10,000

Are
they

that
good

Are

then
?
<s>
Yes

People
of

serve

there

middle-class

They

Underclass

They
are
not

many

Some

Whether

The

still
encircling
former
Prime
Minister

his
fallen
socialist

are
like
fly
buzzing
around

rotting
carcass
.
<s>
In
the
mid-June
round
of
voting
,
Greeks
gave
no
clear
mandate
to
any
single
political
party
.
<s>
The
ad
interim
coalition
government
that
emerged
from
post-electoral
haggling
wa
,
in
essence
,
little
more
than
the
ill-conceived
offspring
of
ideological
miscegenation
:
On
one
side
,
the
center-right
New
Democracy
Party
,
headed
by
Constantine
Mitsotakis
.
<s>
On
the
other
,
the
so-called
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
--
a
quaint
and
rather
deceptive
title
for
a
merger
of
the
pro-Soviet
Communist
Party
of
Greece
and
it
Euro-Communist
cousin
,
the
Hellenic
Left
.
<s>
The
unifying
bond
for
this
left-right
mismatch
wa
plain
:
PASOK
-LRB-
Mr.
Papandreou
's
party
-RRB-
a
common
political
enemy
.
<s>
The
ostensible
goal
wa
a
mop-up
of
government
corruption
,
purportedly
at
all
level
,
but
the
main
mark
were
Mr.
Papandreou
and
his
closest
associate
.
<s>
In
point
of
fact
,
this
catharsis
wa
overdue
by
decade
.
<s>
When
reduced
to
buzzword
status
in
ex
parte
pledge
,
however
,
the
notion
transmogrified
into
a
promised
assault
,
with
target
primarily
for
political
gain
,
not
justice
.
<s>
With
regard
to
Greece
's
long-bubbling
bank-looting
scandal
,
Mr.
Papandreou
's
principal
accuser
remains
George
Koskotas
,
former
owner
of
the
Bank
of
Crete
and
self-confessed
embezzler
,
now
residing
in
a
jail
cell
in
Salem
,
Mass.
,
from
where
he
is
fighting
extradition
proceeding
that
would
return
him
to
Greece
.
<s>
Mr.
Koskotas
's
credibility
is
,
at
best
,
problematic
.
<s>
He
ha
ample
motive
to
shift
the
blame
,
and
his
testimony
ha
also
been
found
le
than
forthright
on
numerous
point
.
<s>
Nevertheless
,
the
New
Democracy
and
Communist
party
herald
his
assertion
a
proof
of
PASOK
complicity
.
<s>
Among
unanswered
question
are
whether
Mr.
Papandreou
received
$
23
million
of
stolen
Bank
of
Crete
fund
and
an
additional
$
734,000
in
bribe
,
a
contended
;
whether
the
prime
minister
ordered
state
agency
to
deposit
some
$
57
million
in
Mr.
Koskotas
's
bank
and
then
skim
off
the
interest
;
and
,
what
PASOK
's
cut
wa
from
the
$
210
million
Mr.
Koskotas
pinched
.
<s>
Two
former
minister
were
so
heavily
implicated
in
the
Koskotas
affair
that
PASOK
member
of
Parliament
voted
to
refer
them
to
the
special
court
.
<s>
But
eluding
parliamentary
probe
wa
the
case
of
million
of
drachma
Mr.
Koskotas
funneled
into
New
Democracy
coffer
.
<s>
In
the
end
,
the
investigation
produced
only
circumstantial
evidence
and
``
indication
''
that
point
to
PASOK
,
not
clinching
proof
.
<s>
On
another
issue
,
Greeks
were
told
how
their
national
intelligence
agency
,
the
EYP
,
regularly
monitored
the
telephone
conversation
of
prominent
figure
,
including
key
opposition
politician
,
journalist
and
PASOK
cabinet
member
.
<s>
Despite
convincing
argument
,
it
wa
never
established
that
Mr.
Papandreou
personally
ordered
or
directed
the
wiretap
.
<s>
The
central
weakness
of
the
``
scandal
''
debate
wa
pointed
up
especially
well
when
discussion
focused
on
arm
deal
and
kickback
.
<s>
The
coalition
government
tried
to
show
that
PASOK
minister
had
received
hefty
sum
for
OKing
the
purchase
of
F-16
Fighting
Falcon
and
Mirage
2000
combat
aircraft
,
produced
by
the
U.S.based
General
Dynamics
Corp.
and
France
's
Avions
Marcel
Dassault
,
respectively
.
<s>
Naturally
,
neither
General
Dynamics
nor
Dassault
could
be
expected
to
hamper
it
prospective
future
dealing
by
making
disclosure
of
sum
paid
-LRB-
or
not
-RRB-
to
various
Greek
official
for
service
rendered
.
<s>
So
it
seems
that
Mr.
Mitsotakis
and
his
communist
chum
may
have
unwittingly
served
Mr.
Papandreou
a
moral
victory
on
a
platter
:
PASOK
,
whether
guilty
or
not
,
can
now
traipse
the
countryside
condemning
the
whole
affair
a
a
witch
hunt
at
Mr.
Papandreou
's
expense
.
<s>
But
while
verbal
high
jinks
alone
wo
n't
help
PASOK
regain
power
,
Mr.
Papandreou
should
never
be
underestimated
.
<s>
First
came
his
predictable
fusillade
:
He
charged
the
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
had
sold
out
it
leftist
tenet
by
collaborating
in
a
right-wing
plot
aimed
at
ousting
PASOK
and
thwarting
the
course
of
socialism
in
Greece
.
<s>
Then
,
to
buttress
his
credibility
with
the
left
,
he
enticed
some
smaller
leftist
party
to
stand
for
election
under
the
PASOK
banner
.
<s>
Next
,
he
continued
to
court
the
communist
--
many
of
whom
feel
betrayed
by
the
left-right
coalition
's
birth
--
by
bringing
into
PASOK
a
well-respected
Communist
Party
candidate
.
<s>
For
balance
,
and
in
hope
of
gaining
some
disaffected
centrist
vote
,
he
managed
to
attract
a
former
New
Democracy
Party
representative
and
known
political
enemy
of
Mr.
Mitsotakis
.
<s>
Thus
PASOK
head
for
the
poll
not
only
with
diminished
scandal-stench
,
but
also
with
``
seal
of
approval
''
from
representative
of
it
harshest
accuser
.
<s>
Crucial
a
these
election
are
for
Greece
,
pressing
issue
of
state
are
getting
lost
in
the
shuffle
.
<s>
The
country
's
future
NATO
participation
remains
unsure
,
for
instance
.
<s>
Greece
also
must
revamp
major
piece
of
legislation
in
preparation
for
the
1992
target
of
heightened
Common
Market
cooperation
.
<s>
Greece
's
bilateral
relation
with
the
U.S.
need
attention
soon
a
well
.
<s>
For
one
,
the
current
accord
concerning
U.S.
military
base
in
Greece
lapse
in
May
1990
.
<s>
Negotiations
for
a
new
agreement
were
frozen
before
the
June
election
,
but
the
clock
is
running
.
<s>
Another
matter
of
concern
is
the
extradition
of
Mohammed
Rashid
,
a
Palestinian
terrorist
who
is
wanted
in
the
U.S.
for
the
1982
bombing
of
a
Pan
American
Airways
flight
.
<s>
The
Greek
court
have
decided
in
favor
of
extradition
in
the
Rashid
case
,
but
the
matter
awaits
final
approval
from
Greece
's
next
justice
minister
.
<s>
The
Greeks
seem
barely
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
case
a
a
litmus
test
of
whether
Greece
will
be
counted
in
or
out
for
international
effort
to
combat
terrorism
.
<s>
That
PASOK
could
win
the
election
outright
is
improbable
;
the
Greek
press
,
previously
eager
to
palm
off
PASOK
's
line
,
ha
turned
on
Mr.
Papandreou
with
a
wild-eyed
vengeance
.
<s>
Yet
the
possibility
of
another
lash-up
government
is
all
too
real
.
<s>
If
Mr.
Papandreou
becomes
the
major
opposition
leader
,
he
could
hamstring
a
conservative-led
coalition
.
<s>
Also
,
he
could
force
new
election
early
next
year
by
frustrating
the
procedure
for
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
republic
in
March
.
<s>
New
Democracy
ha
once
again
glaringly
underestimated
the
opponent
and
linked
it
own
prospect
to
negative
reaction
against
PASOK
,
forgetting
to
tend
to
either
program
clarity
or
the
rectification
of
internal
squabble
.
<s>
As
for
Mr.
Papandreou
?
<s>
He
's
not
exactly
sitting
pretty
at
this
stage

<s>
But
since

n't
yield
on
these
matter
,
and
eventually
begin
talking
directly
to
the
ANC
,
the
expectation
and
promise
raised
by
yesterday
's
release
will
turn
to
disillusionment
and
unrest
.
<s>
If
it
doe
,
the
large
number
of
right-wing
white
,
who
oppose
any
concession
to
the
black
majority
,
will
step
up
their
agitation
and
threat
to
take
matter
into
their
own
hand
.
<s>
The
newly
released
ANC
leader
also
will
be
under
enormous
pressure
.
<s>
The
government
is
watching
closely
to
see
if
their
presence
in
the
township
lead
to
increased
anti-government
protest
and
violence
;
if
it
doe
,
Pretoria
will
use
this
a
a
reason
to
keep
Mr.
Mandela
behind
bar
.
<s>
Pretoria
ha
n't
forgotten
why
they
were
all
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
first
place
:
for
sabotage
and
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
.
<s>
In
addition
,
the
government
is
figuring
that
the
release
could
create
a
split
between
the
internal
and
external
wing
of
the
ANC
and
between
the
newly
freed
leader
and
those
activist
who
have
emerged
a
leader
inside
the
country
during
their
imprisonment
.
<s>
In
order
to
head
off
any
division
,
Mr.
Mandela
,
in
a
meeting
with
his
colleague
before
they
were
released
,
instructed
them
to
report
to
the
ANC
headquarters
in
Lusaka
a
soon
a
possible
.
<s>
The
men
also
will
be
faced
with
bridging
the
generation
gap
between
themselves
and
the
country
's
many
militant
black
youth
,
the
so-called
young
lion
who
are
anxious
to
see
the
old
lion
in
action
.
<s>
Says
Peter
Mokaba
,
president
of
the
South
African
Youth
Congress
:
``
We
will
be
expecting
them
to
act
like
leader
of
the
ANC
.
''
<s>
They
never
considered
themselves
to
be
anything
else
.
<s>
At
last
night
's
rally
,
they
called
on
their
follower
to
be
firm
,
yet
disciplined
,
in
their
opposition
to
apartheid
.
<s>
``
We
emphasize
discipline
because
we
know
that
the
government
is
very
,
very
sensitive
,
''
said
Andrew
Mlangeni
,
another
early
Umkhonto
leader
who
is
now
63
.
<s>
``
We
want
to
see
Nelson
Mandela
and
all
our
comrade
out
of
prison
,
and
if
we
are
n't
disciplined
we
may
not
see
them
here
with
u
